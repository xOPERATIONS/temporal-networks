Things to think about when you create a PR:
* Please make the title of your PR meaningful, ie. "Add tests against edge cases" is better than "made changes"
* Did the source code change? Make sure to run `make doc` and commit the documentation changes!
* Write a full description of the specific changes being made. Feel free to use bullet points
* Add links to any Jira tickets being addressed
* If there are additional testing procedures beyond the normal `make test` workflow, describe them here
* If there are any relevant screenshots, data products from your change, include them here
