//! # Schedule
//! Defines an API designed to be exported to WASM that can perform time math without requiring the user to understand the underlying data structures or algorithms.
//!
//! ## Nomenclature (and some types)
//!
//! We're drawing terminology from existing planners and the literature on temporal plans. Eg. see [1] pg 519 (also in docs/references/).
//!
//! * **`Schedule`**: a set of temporal constraints describing a set of Episodes to occur. Our implementation of `Schedule` can currently handle Episodes that occur in series or parallel (or any mix thereof)
//! * **Event**: a moment in time in the `Schedule`
//! * **`Episode`**: A pair of start and end `Event`s
//! * **`Interval`**: A span of time represented in [lower, upper] range
//! * **Duration**: An interval in the context of a `Episode`, ie, the interval between the start and end events. In English, an Episode with a [lower, upper] duration is "an episode that will take between lower and upper units of time to complete".
