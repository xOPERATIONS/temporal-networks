## Usage

TBD

## Development

### Dependencies

1. [Install rust/cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
2. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (or use a version manager like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
3. Install `make`
  * Linux/Unix: it's probably already on your system. If not, google "install make on [your OS here]"
  * Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm

### Developer Installation

Install `wasm-pack` alongside node dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

### Testing

* Test everything - Rust, WASM, and JS
  ```sh
  make test -k
  ```
  (You don't have to use `-k` but it ensures all tests run even if an earlier test fails (see [`make` documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Errors.html)))
* Just test Rust
  ```sh
  make test.rust
  ```
* Just test WASM and JS
  ```sh
  make test.js
  ```

### Publishing

Note, the version in `Cargo.toml` is what determines the version in NPM. The version in ./package.json does not affect anything.

You must be logged in to npmjs.org. Recommend using an ~/.npmrc file with:

```
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOURTOKEN
```

```sh
make publish
```
